# 8080 Cpu Emulation and Simple Operating System

You need to use an assembler to produce the executable machine code for your emulator. 

Use the simple assembler at , http://asdasd.rpg.fi/~svo/i8080/ which helps a lot in writing the assembly
code. You can directly download the executable .com file from this site with some browsers.

The project folder contains Makefile to compilation
